# The purpose of the PodDisruptionBudget here is to never allow evicting pods created by prow.
# Eviction of pods can happen for one of two reasons:
# * Cluster autoscaler downscaling
# * Someome/Something using `kubectl drain`
#
# It is still possible to delete the pods via a normal delete call. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/safely-drain-node/#the-eviction-api
